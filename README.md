# NFP_Dengue

**Scripts used for simulation, computing, analysis and to generate figures**


combination.pl: This script is used to geneerate the all possible combinations (18 to 22) of 25 virus strains 

correlation_pairwise.pl: This script is used to compute the pairwise correlation based on ID50 values in two ways: serumwise, strainwise

correlation_pairwise_groupwise.pl: This script is used to compute the pairwise correlation based on ID50 values between groups (N30, P0 and P30)

compute_ratio_day30_day0.pl: This script is used to compute the ratio between P30 and P0

donorwise_ID50_comparison_scatterplot.R: This script is used to generate scatterplots for the 10 donors (using serum data from P0 and P30)

donorwise_NFPresults_comparison_scatterplot.R: This script is used to generate scatterplots for the 10 donors (using NFP prediction results of P0 and P30)

ratio_day30_day0_ID50_heatmap.R: This script is used to generate heatmap using the data computed from compute_ratio_day30_day0.pl

gen_theoretical_comb_w-var_modified.m: This script is used to simulate serum data using antibody neutralization data
